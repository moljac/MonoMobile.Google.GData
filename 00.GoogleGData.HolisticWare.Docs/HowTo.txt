		Samples
		WP
	
Procedure
	
	0. google gdata api original is for desktop versions
	
	1. added mobile
		add project "least common denominator"/"smallest subset"
		WP (SIlverlight) took too much time to fix so it is temporarily dropped from schedule
	   
		started with MonoMobile (MA and MT)
		
		with Project Linker added links
		
	2. rename google solution structure (directories and projects)
		projects w/o extensions are desktop projects (original) with some modifications.
		Modifications are perfromed with partial classes and adding classes that would silence
		the compiler (System.Diagnostics), or moving some partial implementations to desktop
		projects (Registry stuff).

	3. all desktop projects target .net 3.5
	   MT target 4.0
	   do not copy MT project under windows and include in solution it has to be 
	   added through MD on mac

	4. on 
		Windows and MacOSX 
		Core.Client.MT 
			compiles fine (Trace Problem) w/o referencing our System.Diagnostics.MT project
			to make solution rebuild remove System.Diagnostics.MT ref

		MacOSX
		Core.Client.MT 
			does not compile w/o referencing our System.Diagnostics.MT project
			so add reference on MacOSX or ignore: Thet type T exists in both ...
